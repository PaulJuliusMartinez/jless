  # Individual Releases

  def self.v0_9_0_release
    release_boilerplate('v0.9.0', INTEL_AND_APPLE_ARM_BINARIES) do
      p1 = p(<<~P)
        The newest version of jless ships with a handful of new helpful features:
      P

      feature1 = li(<<~LI)
        A #{code('ys')} command to copy unescaped string literals to the clipboard
      LI

      feature2 = li(<<~LI)
        A family of printing #{code('p')} commands, analogous to the #{code('y')}
        commands, that print simply content to the screen. Useful for viewing long
        string values, or if the clipboard functionality isn't working
      LI

      feature3 = li(<<~LI)
        Line numbers! Both absolute and relative
      LI

      feature4 = li(<<~LI)
        #{code('C')} and #{code('E')} commands, analogous to the existing #{code('c')} and #{code('e')} commands, for deeply collapsing/expanding values
      LI

      main_features = ul([feature1, feature2, feature3, feature4].join("\n"))

      new_features = section('Full list of new features', [
        <<~ITEM,
          A new command #{code('ys')} will copy unescaped string literals to the
          clipboard. Control characters remain escaped.
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          The length of Arrays and size of Objects is now shown before the container previews
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          Add a new family of "print" commands, that nearly map to the existing copy
          commands, that will simply print a value to the screen. This is useful for
          viewing the entirety of long string values all at once, or if the clipboard
          functionality is not working; mouse-tracking will be temporarily disabled,
          allowing you to use your terminal's native clipboard capabilities to select
          and copy the desired text.
        ITEM
        p(<<~P) +
          Support showing line numbers, both absolute and/or relative. Absolute line
          numbers refer to what line number a given node would appear on if the document
          were pretty printed. This means there are discontinuities when in data mode because
          closing brackets and braces aren't displayed. Relative line numbers show how far a
          line is relative to the currently focused line. The behavior of the various
          combinations of these settings matches vim: when using just relative line numbers
          alone, the focused line will show 0, but when both flags are enabled the focused
          line will show its absolute line number.
        P
        p(<<~P) +
          Absolute line numbers are enabled by default, but not relative line numbers. These
          can be enabled/disabled/re-enabled via command line flags #{code('--line-numbers')},
          #{code('--no-line-numbers')}, #{code('--relative-line-numbers')} and
          #{code('--no-relative-line-numbers')}, or via the short flags #{code('-n')},
          #{code('-N')}, #{code('-r')}, and #{code('-R')} respectively.
        P
        p(<<~P) +
          These settings can also be modified while jless is running. Entering
          #{code(':set number')}/#{code(':set relativenumber')} will enable these settings,
          #{code(':set nonumber')}/#{code(':set norelativenumber')} will disable them, and
          #{code(':set number!')}/#{code(':set relativenumber!')} will toggle them, matching
          vim's behavior.
        P
        p(<<~P),
          There is not yet support for a jless config file, so if you would like relative
          line numbers by default, it is recommended to set up an alias:
          #{code('alias jless=jless --line-numbers --relative-line-numbers')}.
        P
        <<~ITEM,
          You can jump to an exact line number using #{code('<count>g')} or
          #{code('<count>G')}. When using #{code('<count>g')} (lowercase 'g'), if the
          desired line number is hidden inside of a collapsed container, the last visible
          line number before the desired one will be focused. When using #{code('<count>G')}
          (uppercase 'G'), all the ancestors of the desired line will be expanded to
          ensure it is visible.
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          Add #{code('C')} and #{code('E')} commands, analogous to the existing #{code('c')}
          and #{code('e')} commands, to deeply collapse/expand a node and all its siblings.
        ITEM
      ])

      improvements = section('Improvements', [
        <<~ITEM,
          In data mode, when a array element is focused, the highlighting on the index
          label (e.g., #{code('[8]')}) is now inverted. Additionally, a #{code('â–¶')} is always
          displayed next to the currently focused line, even if the focused node is a
          primitive. Together these changes should make it more clear which line is
          focused, especially when the terminal's current style doesn't support
          dimming (#{code('ESC [ 2 m')}).
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          When using the #{code('c')} and #{code('e')} commands (and the new #{code('C')}
          and #{code('E')} commands), the focused row will stay at the same spot on the
          screen. (Previously jless would try to keep the same row visible at the top of
          the screen, which didn't make sense.)
        ITEM
      ])

      bug_fixes = section('Bug Fixes', [
        <<~ITEM,
          Scrolling with the mouse will now move the viewing window, rather than the cursor.
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          When searching, jless will do a better job jumping to the first match after the
          cursor; previously if a user started a search while focused on the opening of a
          Object or Array, any matches inside that container were initially skipped over.
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          When jumping to a search match that is inside a collapsed container, search
          matches will continue to be highlighted after expanding the container.
        ITEM
        <<~ITEM,
          [#{issue(71)}/#{pr(98)}]: jless will return a non-zero exit code if it fails to

          jless now re-renders the screen by emitting "clear line" escape codes
          (#{code('ESC [ 2 K')}) for each line, instead of a single "clear screen" escape
          #{code('code (ESC [ 2 J')}), in the hopes of reducing flicking when scrolling.

  def self.v0_8_0_release
    release_boilerplate('v0.8.0', ONLY_INTEL_BINARIES) do
      p1 = p(<<~P)
        This release ships with two major new features: basic YAML support
        and copying to clipboard!
      P

      p2 = p(<<~P)
        #{code('jless')} will now check the file extension of the input file,
        and automatically parse #{code('.yml')} and #{code('.yaml')} files as
        YAML and use the same viewer as for JSON data. Alternatively passing in
        the #{code('--yaml')} flag will force #{code('jless')} to parse the
        input as YAML and can be used when reading in YAML data from stdin.
        YAML aliases are automatically expanded, but their corresponding anchors
        are not visible, nor are comments. YAML supports non-string keys, and
        even non-scalar keys in mappings (e.g., the key of map can be an array
        with multiple elements). Non-string keys are shown with square brackets,
        e.g., #{code('[true]: "value"')}, instead of quotes. Non-scalar keys are
        handled on the screen and displayed properly, but you cannot expand and
        collapse their individual elements.
      P

      p3 = p(<<~P)
        While navigating data, jless also now supports copying various items to
        your system clipboard.
      P

      copy_commands = ul do
        yy = li(<<~LI)
          #{code('yy')} will copy the value of the currently focused node,
          pretty printed
        LI
        yv = li(<<~LI)
          #{code('yv')} will copy the value of the currently focused node in a
          "nicely" printed one-line format
        LI
        yk = li("#{code('yk')} will copy the key of the current key/value pair")
        yp = li(<<~LI)
          #{code('yp')} will copy the path from the root JSON element to the
          currently focused node, e.g., #{code('.foo[3].bar')}
        LI
        yb = li(<<~LI)
          #{code('yb')} functions like #{code('yp')}, but always uses the
          bracket form for object keys, e.g., #{code('["foo"][3]["bar"]')},
          which is useful if the environment where you'll paste the path doesn't
          support the #{code('.key')} format, like in Python
        LI

        jq_link = code {a(href: 'https://stedolan.github.io/jq/') {'jq'}}
        yq = li(<<~LI)
          #{code('yq')} will copy a #{jq_link} style path that will select the
          currently focused node, e.g., #{code('.foo[].bar')}
