                            [1mSUMMARY OF JLESS COMMANDS[0m

       Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, [4mN[0m, which will
       repeatedly perform a command the given number of times. A key
       preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^E is ctrl-E.

  q  ^c            Exit jless.

  F1 :help         Show this help screen.

                                    [1mMOVING[0m

  j  DownArrow  *  Move focus down one line (or [4mN[0m lines).
  ^n Enter

  k  UpArrow    *  Move focus up   one line (or [4mN[0m lines).
  ^p Backspace

  h  LeftArrow     When focused on an expanded object or array, collapse the
                     object or array. Otherwise, move focus to the parent of
                     the focused node.

  H                Focus the parent of the focused node, even if it is an
                     expanded object or array.

  l  RightArrow    When focused on a collapsed object or array, expand the
                     object or array. When focused on an expanded object or
                     array, move focus to the first child. When focused on
                     non-container values, does nothing.

  J         *  Move to the focused node's next     sibling 1 or [4mN[0m times.
  K         *  Move to the focused node's previous sibling 1 or [4mN[0m times.

  w         *  Move forward   until the next change in depth 1 or [4mN[0m times.
  b         *  Move backwards until the next change in depth 1 or [4mN[0m times.

  PageDown  *  Move down by one window (or [4mN[0m windows).
  PageUp    *  Move up   by one window (or [4mN[0m windows).

  0  ^         Move to the first sibling of the focused node's parent.
  $            Move to the last  sibling of the focused node's parent.

  g  Home      Focus the first line in the input.
  G  End       Focus the last  line in the input.

  c            Collapse the focused node and all its siblings.
  e            Expand   the focused node and all its siblings.

  Space        Toggle the collapsed state of the currently focused node.

                                    [1mSCROLLING[0m

  ^e        *  Scroll down one line (or [4mN[0m lines).
  ^y        *  Scroll up   one line (or [4mN[0m lines).

  ^d        *  Scroll down by half the height of the screen (or by [4mN[0m lines).
  ^u        *  Scroll up   by half the height of the screen (or by [4mN[0m lines).
                 For this command and ^d, focus is also moved by the specified
                 number of lines. If no count is specified, the number of
                 lines to scroll by is recalled from previous executions.

  zz           Move the focused node to the center of the screen.
  zt           Move the focused node to the top of the screen.
  zb           Move the focused node to the bottom of the screen.

  .         *  Scroll a truncated value one char to the right (or [4mN[0m chars).
  ,         *  Scroll a truncated value one char to the left  (or [4mN[0m chars).
  ;            Scroll a truncated value all the way to the end, or, if
                 already at the end, back to the start.

  <            Decrease the indentation of every line by one (or [4mN[0m) tabs.
  >            Increase the indentation of every line by one (or [4mN[0m) tabs.

                                     [1mSEARCH[0m

      jless supports full-text search over the input JSON.

  /pattern  *  Search forward   for the given pattern (or its [4mN[0mth occurrence).
  ?pattern  *  Search backwards for the given pattern (or its [4mN[0mth occurrence).

  *         *  Move to the next occurrence of the object key on the focused
                 line (or move forward [4mN[0m occurrences)
  #         *  Move to the previous occurrence of the object key on the
                 focused line (or move backwards [4mN[0m occurrences)

  n         *  Move in the search direction to the next match (or forward
                 [4mN[0m matches).
  N         *  Move in the opposite of the search direction to the previous match
                 (or previous [4mN[0m matches).

      Searching uses "smart case" by default. If the input pattern doesn't
      contain any capital letters, a case insensitive search will be
      performed. If there are any capital letters, it will be case sensitive.
      You can force a case-sensitive search by appending '/s' to your query.

      A trailing slash will be removed from a pattern; to search for a
      pattern ending in '/' (or '/s'), just add another '/' to the end.

      Search patterns are interpreted as mostly standard regular expressions,
      with one exception. Because JSON data contains many square and curly
      brackets ("[]{}"), these characters do *not* take on their usual
      meanings (specifying characters classes and repetition counts
      respectively) and are instead interpreted literally.

      To use character classes or repetition counts, escape these characters
      with a backslash.

      Some examples:

        /[1, 2, 3]      matches an array: [1, 2, 3]
        /\[bch\]at      matches "bat", "cat" or "hat"
        /{}             matches an empty object
        /(ha)\{2,3}     matches "haha" or "hahaha"

      For exhaustive documentation of the supported regular expression syntax,
      see the following documentation of the underlying regex engine:

        https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/index.html#syntax

                                  [1mSEARCH INPUT[0m

      The search is *not* performed over the original input, but over a
      single-line pretty formatted version of the input JSON. Consider the
      following two ways to format an equivalent JSON blob:

        {"a":1,"b":true,"c":[null,{},[],"hello"]}

        {
          "a": 1,
          "b": true,
          "c": [
            null,
            {},
            [],
          "hello"
          ]
        }

      jless will create an internal representation formatted as follows:

        { "a": 1, "b": true, "c": [null, {}, [], "hello"] }

      (No spaces inside empty objects or arrays, one space inside objects
      with values, no spaces inside array square brackets, no space between
      an object key and ':', one space after the ':', and one space after
      commas separating object entries and array elements.)

      Searching will be performed over this internal representation so that
      patterns can include multiple elements without worrying about
      newlines or the exact input format.

      When the input is newline-delimited JSON, an actual newline will
      separate each top-level JSON element in the internal representation.

                             [1mDATA MODE VS LINE MODE[0m

      jless starts in "data" mode, which displays the JSON data in a more
      streamlined fashion: no closing delimiters for objects or arrays,
      no trailing commas, no quotes around object keys that are valid
      identifiers in JavaScript. It also shows single-line previews of
      objects and arrays, and array indexes before array elements. Note
      that when using full-text search, object keys will still be
      surrounded by quotes.

      By pressing 'm', you can switch jless to "line" mode, which displays
      the input as pretty-printed JSON.

      In line mode you can press '%' when focused on an open or close
      delimiter of an object or array to jump to its matching pair.
