[`jless`](https://jless.io) is a command-line JSON viewer. Use it as a
replacement for whatever combination of `less`, `jq`, `cat` and your
editor you currently use for viewing JSON files. It is written in Rust
and can be installed as a single standalone binary.

### Features

- Clean syntax highlighted display of JSON data, omitting quotes around
  object keys, closing object and array delimiters, and trailing commas.
- Expand and collapse objects and arrays so you can see both the high-
  and low-level structure of the data.
- A wealth of vim-inspired movement commands for efficiently moving
  around and viewing data.
- Full regex-based search for finding exactly the data you're looking
  for.

`jless` currently supports macOS and Linux. Windows support is planned.
